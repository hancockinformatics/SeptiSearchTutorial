# General Troubleshooting

## Overview
If you run into problem or encounter bugs while using SeptiSearch, try resetting
the inputs to their original state, using the provided "Reset this page" buttons 
when available. Alternatively you can refresh your browser window to reload the
app (CTRL+F5). 

{: .note }
While refreshing the page will likely resolve most issues, it will reset all inputs/filters, meaning you will need to reapply any searches or inputs after the refresh.

## 'Perform Pathway Enrichment' & 'Test for Enriched Sepsis Gene Sets' tabs
If you encounter a problem with the *Perform Pathway Enrichment* or 
*Test for Enriched Sepsis Gene Sets* tabs, please ensure your inputs match all
the specified criteria for each tab before reporting the problem via a Github
issue.

## Submitting a GitHub issue
If you've tried resetting and refreshing the page, and ensured your inputs 
follow any given criteria, you can submit an issue to the SeptiSearch GitHub 
page using the link below. You simply need to create an account (its free!), and
follow the steps provided. Please provide as much detail as you can about the
issue, including what steps you took when experiencing the problem. Screenshots,
along with inputs (for the *Perform Pathway Enrichment* and *Test for Enriched Sepsis Gene Sets*)
are greatly encouraged.

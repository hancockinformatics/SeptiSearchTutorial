The second tab provides a more visual way of search the curated gene sets, with
a greater focus on the molecules frequently occuring within SeptiSearch.

The plot shows the most common molecules in the database, coloured by COVID
status, with the sidebar on the left providing a number of ways to filter the
data. The "Reset this page" button at the bottom of the sidebar will reset all
inputs, returning the plot to its original state.

You can click one of the bars in the plot to show all entries for that molecule
in SeptiSearch, and download this table using the button at the bottom of the
sidebar.

Additionally, as this plot is rendered by Plotly, there are a number of other 
ways in which you can interact with it, such as click-and-drag to zoom in on a 
specific part of the plot. The controls at the top right of the plot also 
provide a number of additional options.
